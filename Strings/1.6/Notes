- first attempt was ok, matched bad example in book.
- same problem, string concatenation is in O(n^2) time. 
- An analogue of StringBuilder in python would be required. 
- the book discusses an option to determine wether the output would be shorter before starting the compression loop. 
- benefits to this are decreased space (string builder could be set to optimal size), drawbacks are a second loop with 
duplicated code
